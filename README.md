# Financial-Risk-Prediction-using-IBM-Auto-AI
## Project Objectives
In this workshop you will learnyou will learn how to  
    ⇾ Work with Watson Studio  
    ⇾ Create a project in Watson Studio  
    ⇾ Use Auto Ai experiment to create a model  
    ⇾ Deploy the ML model as a webserver  
    ⇾ Integrating Model and Node-RED Service  
    ⇾ Build an Application using Node-RED which takes inputs from the user and showcases the prediction on UI  
## Prerequisites  
To complete this project you must have an IBM account   
• Click [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/login) to register for IBM   
• lick [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/login) to log in to IBM Account  
## Create IBM Services
In this activity, you will be creating the Necessary IBM services. The following are the services that you have to create.  
 ⇾ Watson studio  
 ⇾ Node-RED  
 ⇾ Cloud Object Storage service (COS)  
 ⇾ Machine Learning service (ML)  
COS and ML services will e created while creating a Watson Studio Project  
### Create Watson Studio Project  
To create the service click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAT3qALIQXM) to watch the video and follow the steps.  
### Create Node-RED Service  
To create the service click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beCCPIH0-8c) to watch the video and follow the steps.  
## Build Machine Learning Model
In this activity, you will learn how you can save a pipeline as a Watson Machine Learning model, deploy the model, and score it to view a prediction.  
This Activity  contains the Following Tasks  
⇾Collect the data set  
⇾Create Watson Studio project  
⇾Add Auto AI experiment  
⇾Run AI Experiment  
⇾Save the model  
⇾Deploy the model  
### Collect The Data Set
Please click [here](https://github.com/Madhan961/Financial-Risk-Prediction-using-IBM-Auto-AI/blob/main/DATA/fraud_dataset.csv) to download the dataset. 
In this Activity, We gonna build a machine learning model that predicts  fraudulent transactions based on the following parameters 
• Gender,  
• Marital Status,  
• Dependents,  
• Education,  
• Self-employed,  
• Applicant income,  
• Co-applicant income,  
• Loan amount,  
• Loan term,  
• Credit history,  
• Housing,  
• Locality.  
### Create Watson Studio Project
A project is how you organize your resources to achieve a particular goal.
